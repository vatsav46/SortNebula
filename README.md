Iam using these three types of sorts.

MERGE SORT:

Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm based on the Divide and Conquer principle. It divides the given array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. The merg() function is used for merging two halves. The merge(l, m, h) is key process that assumes that a[l..m] and a[m+1..h] are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one.

QUICK SORT:

QuickSort is also based on Divide and Conquer principle. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.Iam always using the starting element as pivot.

BINARY INSERTION SORT:

We can use binary search to reduce the number of comparisons in normal insertion sort. Binary Insertion Sort uses binary search to find the proper location to insert the selected item at each iteration. 
In normal insertion sort, it takes O(n) comparisons(at nth iteration) in worst case. We can reduce it to O(log n) by using binary search.
